 do two recursion. different from pathSumII that start can be any node, 
 * so we have 1st recur.
1stï¼š recursively travel tree to find answers of current node + ans of left child + ans of right child.
2nd: find the path from current node to child that adds up to sum
Complexity:  
If the tree is balanced, then each node is reached from its ancestors (+ itself) 
only, which are up to log n. Thus, the time complexity for a balanced tree is O (n * log n).
However, in the worst-case scenario where the binary 
tree has the same structure as a linked list, the time complexity is indeed O (n ^ 2)
O(H) space - height of binary tree
